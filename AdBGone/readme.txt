AdBGone is an advanced popup and advertisement killer.

It will stop popups before they are displayed
and replace banners/advertisements with the AdBGone
logo, solid color, or HTML of your choice.

This was a project I started as an experiment to see
if I could generate any revenue from it.

I haven't done any work on this application since
August of 2003 so I believe I should give the source code away.
There is a registration feature on this application but the key
encoder is included under 'adbgone/encoder'.

In order to enable protection you must first download
the known advertisement hosts from my site (www.ccorpsoft.com).
This can be done through the menu, under 'Update Hosts'.
There weren't many testers for this project so I am sure there
will be a bug or two. Enjoy.

If you re-use my code please respect my project and keep
my name somewhere in the credits.
